<current_state>
Milestone v1 audit completed. All 9 phases executed (8 verified, Phase 8 not started).

25/28 requirements satisfied. The 3 unsatisfied are all accessibility requirements from Phase 8 which was intentionally skipped.

Audit report created at `.planning/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` — not yet committed.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**This session:**
- Ran `/gsd:audit-milestone`
- Read all 8 VERIFICATION.md files
- Noted Phase 7 missing VERIFICATION.md (but functionally complete)
- Spawned integration checker — verified all 9 cross-phase integration points connected
- Verified 3 E2E flows working (page navigation, operation lifecycle, async data loading)
- Created `.planning/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` with full results

**Overall milestone:**
- 34 plans executed across 9 phases
- 1.5 hours total execution time
- Monolith split from 2500 lines to 202 lines (shell.go)
- pkg/adwutil library extracted with tests and examples
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Immediate:**
- Commit audit report

**Decision needed:**
- Option A: `/gsd:complete-milestone v1` — accept tech debt, archive milestone
- Option B: `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` — create phases to close gaps before completing

**Gaps identified:**
1. Phase 7 missing VERIFICATION.md (minor — functionality verified)
2. Phase 8 not started (3 accessibility requirements)
3. Phase 9 missing page integration tests (logic tests exist)
4. GTK markup parsing error with bullet character (noted in STATE.md Pending Todos)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Milestone status: `tech_debt` (not `passed` due to accessibility gaps, not `gaps_found` since no critical blockers)
- Phase 8 (Accessibility) was correctly not started — it's listed in ROADMAP as "Not started"
- Integration check passed — all phases properly wired together
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — milestone functionally complete, just needs closure decision.
</blockers>

<context>
The refactoring milestone achieved its core goals:
- Monolith successfully split into page packages
- Async/operations infrastructure working throughout
- Library extraction complete with tests

Accessibility was always the last phase and could reasonably be deferred to v2 milestone. The user should decide whether to:
1. Complete milestone now (tracking accessibility as future work)
2. Do Phase 8 before completing
</context>

<next_action>
1. Commit audit report: `git add .planning/v1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md && git commit -m "docs: v1 milestone audit"`
2. Choose milestone closure path (A or B above)
3. Run appropriate command
</next_action>
